 *  You may find the CSCourseGraphDB and CSCourseGraphDBHandler examples useful.
 *
 *  The idea here is that some external library is going to walk through the XML file, and your
 *  override method tells Java what to do every time it gets to the next element in the file. This
 *  is a very common but strange-when-you-first-see it pattern. It is similar to the Visitor pattern
 *  we discussed for graphs.
